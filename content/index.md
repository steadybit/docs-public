## Welcome to steadybit

Steadybit provides you visibility into your systems to detect resilience issues proactively and reduce downtime. We follow the principles of Chaos
Engineering and help you to stay in control of your chaos experiments.

Steadybit uses an agent-based approach consisting of a central platform - being the center of control for you - and agents - deployed in your system to discover running hosts, containers and applications.

### You want to set up steadybit?

- See how to get started [setting up the platform](getting-started/10-set-up-platform-agents) or - in case you can't use the SaaS - [how to host the on prem platform on your servers](getting-started/20-install-onprem)
- Learn about different ways to [install the Agents](install-configure/30-install-agents) depending on your system's needs
- Read more about our [agent-based architecture](learn/10-architecture)

### Starting to use steadybit?

- Run your [first experiment in local Kubernetes](getting-started/30-run-experiment-local) or [in AWS EKS](getting-started/40-run-experiment-eks)
