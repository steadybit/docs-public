# Targets

## Table View

The explorer target table gives you an overview of all targets to check, e.g., for completeness of targets or whether a newly installed extension discovers the appropriate target type. You can always see the full details of a target by clicking on it. Depending on your team's permission, you can see the environment Global to see all discovered targets or choose a specific environment to list targets according to your permissions.
