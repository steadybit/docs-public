# Explorer

Steadybit's Explorer shows you an overview of all targets discovered by extensions.
It is perfect to check whether Steadybit has discovered all infrastructure components and where to continue your Chaos Engineering journey.
You can choose between viewing the targets on a table or exploring extensively using the Landscape.
