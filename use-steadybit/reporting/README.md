# Reporting

Steadybit's integrated reporting feature provides you with a comprehensive overview of your experiments, experiment runs and your adoption of Steadybit in terms of users, teams and environments.

You can click on the labels below any report to filter the data shown in the graphs.

All charts can be downloaded as png or pdf files.

## Experiment Runs

The Experiment Runs report gives you an overview of all experiment runs that have been executed.

You can filter the reports by the following criteria:

* Timeframe
* Teams
* Environments

### Number of Runs

Find out how many experiments your teams have run in total.

### Attack Types

Identify which attacks your teams have used most frequently.

### Trigger

Check out what typically triggers an experiment run, e.g., API, CLI, UI, or schedule.

### Result

Drill down into the experiment runs by the result and compare the numbers of completed, canceled, failed, and errored experiment runs.

### Result (Completed vs. Failed)

Compare the portion of completed experiment runs to failed experiment runs to identify the frequency of identifying issues.

### Issues Discovered

Identify how many experiment runs turned from completed to failed. We count experiment failures that were immediately preceded by a completed experiment run.

### Issues Fixed

Identify how many experiment runs turned from failed to completed. We count experiment runs completed that were immediately preceded by a failed experiment run.

## Experiments

The Experiments report gives you an overview of experiments that have been created in your environment.

You can filter the report by the following criteria:

* Timeframe
* Teams
* Environments

### Number of Experiments

Find out how many experiments your teams have designed in total.

### Creation Channel

Identify which channel is used the most across your teams to create an experiment: UI, API, or CLI

### Creation Method

Identify which method is used the most across your teams to create an experiment: From scratch, template, or advice

## Others

These reports give you an overview of the adoption of Steadybit.

You can filter the reports by timeframe.
