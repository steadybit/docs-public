## Emergency Stop

In case a running experiment causes unforeseen severe failures every authenticated user can stop any running experiment by clicking the emergency stop button.
You can find it in the 'Current Activities' at the left.

After that, all running experiments will be stopped and in addition starting new experiments will be prevented (via UI as well as API).
