# Duplicate

To duplicate an experiment, you can do it in two ways:

* by duplicate the experiment via experiment list
* by duplicate the experiment via the experiment designer

## Duplicate via Experiment list

If you are on the experiments overview page, you will find a button with 3 dots next to each experiment. In its dropdown you will find the option `Duplicate Experiment`.

## Duplicate via Experiment Designer

If you are on the experiment designer page, you will find a button ![Button](../../../.gitbook/assets/duplicateButton.png) to duplicate the experiment.

## Duplicated Experiment

If you have duplicated an experiment, you will be required to edit the experiment by name, description, team and environment.

Once you have confirmed that pop-up window, the experiment will be saved and opened in the Experience Designer.
