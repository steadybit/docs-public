# Run History

After you [run an experiment](run.md), you can see the history of all past runs for it in the left sidebar of the "Runs" pane and navigate to that run by clicking it.

You can visit the "Experiments > Experiment Runs" page to get the whole history across multiple teams.\
The filters allow you to select the experiment runs by team, environment, outcome, or time. You can also download a CSV report for that particular selection and use it for further processing.
