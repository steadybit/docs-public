# Manage Teams and Users

Steadybit lives transparency by allowing every user to see the performed actions of other teams and users.
Even so, a Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) gives you the possibility to control fine-grained permissions and determine which parts users can take action.

* Start by defining your [Teams](../../install-and-configure/manage-teams-and-users/teams.md)
* Invite and assign [Users](../../install-and-configure/manage-teams-and-users/users.md) to the teams
* Learn more about [Permissions and Roles](../../install-and-configure/manage-teams-and-users/permissions.md)
