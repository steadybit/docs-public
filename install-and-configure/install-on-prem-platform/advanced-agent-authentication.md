# Advanced Agent Authentication

## Agent authentication using agent-key

By default, the agents are authenticating using the configured agent-key.\
This key is global and all the same for all agents of your organization.

In case your agent key got compromised and you need to rotate the agent key, contact our [support](https://steadybit.com/contact).

## Agent Authentication using [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)

If you want to have more security controls, you can use OIDC for the agent authentication instead of the agent key. This requires a OIDC identity provider (e.g. Keycloak).

For each request to the platform the agent will use an access token which was issued by the identity provider. The platform verifies the token.

### Platform Configuration

To instruct the platform to validate all incoming agent requests against a specific identity provider, set `STEADYBIT_AUTH_AGENT_PROVIDER=OAUTH2` and the `STEADYBIT_AUTH_AGENT_OAUTH2_ISSUER_URI` to the issuer URI of your identity provider.

All options are described in [Platform Configuration Options](advanced-configuration.md#openid-connect-authentication).

### Agent Configuration

To tell the agent to use OIDC, set `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_PROVIDER=OAUTH2`, `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_ISSUER_URI` to the issuer URI of your identity provider and the `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` to the client id to use.\
Alternatively instead of using the issuer URI you can directly configure the `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URI` to tell the agents where to get the access tokens from, this won't try to read the OIDC discovery endpoint.

All options are described in [Agent Configuration Options](../install-agent/advanced-configuration.md).

#### Using client credentials flow

To use the client credentials flow you need to set the `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET` to the client secret.

#### Using password flow (with credentials or mutual TLS)

For using username and password set `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_AUTHORIZATION_GRANT_TYPE=password` and provide a username and password with `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_USERNAME` and `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_PASSWORD`.

For using mutual TLS specify PEM-files containing a X.509 certificate and a PKCS#8 private key by setting `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CERT_KEY_FILE` and `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CERT_CHAIN_FILE`. In case the key is encrypted you can specify the password using `STEADYBIT_AGENT_AUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD`.\
The agent will re-load the certificates when the file changes automatically, but it might take up to ten seconds.
