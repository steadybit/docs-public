# CLI

The [steadybit CLI ](https://github.com/steadybit/cli) allows you to connect your repository to Steadybit and having a single source of truth for all your experiments.
By enabling you to create / update and retrieve your experiment definitions you have the truth versionized at one place. Of course, you can also run your experiments from the command line interface.

This allows you to implement GitOps practices easily.

## Installation

Nothing more than a simple

```bash
npm install -g steadybit
```

Afterwards you have to create a profile and authenticate via an [access token](api/api.md#access-tokens). Check out our public GitHub repository [steadybit CLI](https://github.com/steadybit/cli#authorization) to learn more.

## Usage

The CLI is mostly self explaining. For a detailed documentation have a look at our public GitHub repository [steadybit CLI](https://github.com/steadybit/cli)
