# Slack Notifications

You want to receive a Slack message whenever an experiment has started or failed? This can be achieve via `Settings` -> `Integrations` -> `Slack`.

> If you use an on-prem installation make sure to set the `STEADYBIT_WEB_PUBLIC_URL`, so we can add links to open Steadybit via links in the message.
