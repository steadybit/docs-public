# Webhooks

Steadybit can inform you about events via webhooks. These events can be, e.g., a newly created experiment, a running experiment, or an engaged killswitch.

You can use a [Custom Webhook](custom-webhooks.md) to integrate with other systems and, e.g., trigger an action whenever a new experiment was created. Alternatively, you can prevent an experiment from running or being scheduled by using [Preflight Webhooks](preflight-webhooks.md).
